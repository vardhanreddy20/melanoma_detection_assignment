## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- Initially the accuracy was 65% and there was significant amount of overfitting
- seborrheic keratosis has the least samples
- Melanoma and pigmented benign keratosis are almost equally highly proportional interms of samples and also actinic keratosis and dermatofibroma are also equally proportionate
